# KAL
**K**eep **AL**ive (KAL) keeps moving the mouse around your main screen, simulating pseudo-natural pointer movement, thereby keeping your computer from going into sleep mode. Simply install one package and then run main.py to "look busy" for as long as you wish!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**NOTE:** Uses the pyautogui package to control the mouse. 

Available here: https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/

*pip install PyAutoGUI*
